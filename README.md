<h2>Overview</h2>
This JavaFX application simulates a Facebook post interface, allowing users to interact with posts using reactions like Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry, and Care. It's designed as a learning tool to understand JavaFX and FXML for creating interactive GUI applications.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Display a Facebook-like post with a user profile, content, and interaction buttons.</li>
  <li>React to the post with different reactions.</li>
  <li>Dynamically update and display reaction counts.</li>
  <li>Switch between reactions by clicking icons.</li>
  <li>Show post audience (Public, Friends).</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java: Core programming language for application logic.</li>
  <li>JavaFX: Framework for building the GUI.</li>
  <li>FXML: XML-based language for defining the UI.</li>
  <li>CSS: Styling the JavaFX application.</li>
  <li>IntelliJ IDEA: IDE for development.</li>
</ul>  

<h2>Running the Project</h2>
<p>1. Download this project and download the appropriate JavaFX SDK for your operating system and unzip it to a desired location, for instance /Users/your-user/Downloads/javafx-sdk-21.</p>
<a href="https://openjfx.io/index.html" target="_blank">Openjfx.io</a>

<p>2. Set JDK 21</p>
<p>Go to File -> Project Structure -> Project, and set the project SDK to 21. You can also set the language level to 11 or greater.</p>

<p>3. Create a library</p>
<p>Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries and add the JavaFX 21 SDK as a library to the project. Point to the lib folder of the JavaFX SDK.</p>
<p>Once the library is applied, the JavaFX classes will be recognised by the IDE, and then you can run the Text to Speech project.</p>
